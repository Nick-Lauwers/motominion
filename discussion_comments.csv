1,"Is your clutch the original? If so, I would check it; they have that funky spring plate on them that likes to come apart. On the last one that I did, I used the Barnett extra plate kit. It worked like a champ!",1,4
2,"Does your shift lever still ""spring"" back to center when it's pushed down or lifted up? If the lever does not return to center by itself, the shift pawl spring is probably broken. Once stopped, it's unlikely that you can change more than one gear without rocking the bike back and forth to get the gears to engage / disengage.",1,13
3,"I have a SENA and an iPhone. You have to go to Settings, then Navigation Settings in Google Maps. Then, turn on audio over Bluetooth.",2,4
4,"It would seem that the issue exists between the clutch outer basket and the inner hub. Replacing the friction discs and plates should have worked. Since it didn't, there is an issue with one or more things. My guess is a worn pressure plate or the surface on the inner hub. There may be an issue with the ramp or the throwout bearing, as well. Lastly, a worn clutch cable that has not been lubricated over time can drag and grab. This is only a few things for you to consider and is assuming that the installer did a proper basket and cable adjustment.",3,11
5,Start with a proper by-the-manual clutch adjustment. This is the easiest starting point when checking.,3,6
6,"I've not seen anything bigger than a 13-inch. I checked Memphis Shades, too. I know that there are others, though.",4,17
7,Contact John at Freedom Shields; he will make just about any size that you want if you want something like 16 1/2 inches. But he does make a 16-inch as one of his standard sizes.,4,5
8,"The way that seems to work for me is to use spray brake cleaner from Walmart. Then, take 100-grit emory and score the surface.",5,3
