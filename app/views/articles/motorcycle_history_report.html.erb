KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY
Buying a motorcycle can be exciting but you want to know that you are getting a good deal. No one wants to buy a motorcycle only to find out later that it needs a lot of work.

Aside from vehicle specifications, a VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) number may offer information on whether your motorcycle has ever been junked, salvaged, stolen, or recalled, or whether it has a clear title or lien. It may also be able to tell you whether the vehicle has been in an accident.
