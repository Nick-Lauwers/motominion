1,Harley Davidson Sportster Down-Shifting Issues,"My 2003 Sportster 1200 started having some clutch slipping and down-shifting problems. I adjusted the clutch several times using my HD service manual as a guide. The clutch doesn't slip, but I am still having problems down-shifting. After I ride for about a mile or two, it does not want to down-shift; it's like it gets stuck in neutral and I have to pull over and play with it. I've had to take off in third gear a couple of times. I've changed the primary fluid about four months ago, so that shouldn't be the issue; the level is good, no leaking. I am just wondering if the primary chain could be part of the issue.",5,0
2,How To Hear iPhone-Based Navigation,"I am doing a ride tomorrow and the route is a little detailed, so someone sent me a GPS route that is now uploaded to Google Maps. However, I do not have a GPS (I ride a vintage), so any navigation has to be audio using my SENA. I am fine with the SENA connection to my iPhone, but I cannot get Google Maps to give me audio turn-by-turn instructions. The device shows turns in text with no audio. I have searched around quite a bit, but cannot find anything. Can anyone help?",10,0
3,Unnerving RPM Spike Issue,"I have a 2011 Harley-Davidson GRU that has a strange issue: when I roll on the throttle, it's almost as if an invisible hand pulls in my clutch lever and then releases it. Even the illuminated Green 6 extinguishes, just as it would if someone were touching the clutch. I told my mechanic about this a few months ago and he said that it was time for a new clutch. He replaced the clutch, but the problem is still there. Can someone tell me where to go from here? It's pretty unsettling when I need to roll on the throttle as I merge and I get no power, just RPM.",7,0
4,Chieftain Windshield,"Do they make a lightly tinted, flared 16-inch windshield for the Indian Chieftain? I have seen plenty of 10- and 12-inch windshields, but I need a 16-inch. Any information would be greatly appreciated.",17,0
5,Brake Disc Cleaning,"I have a brake disc that I would like to clean up before putting on my bike. Obviously, a good bead blasting would be ideal, but are there any other methods of cleaning and de-contaminating a brake disc?",14,0
